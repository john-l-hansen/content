Mobii is much more than a television app. It can be used almost anywhere there is a device emitting sound. The most common ones we use are Television, Radio, Beacon, Geofence, Digital Media and Live Events. Anywhere there is sound Mobii can deliver to you.

Television: While watching television on a particular show or during a commercial. 

Radio: While listening to the radio either online, in the car or out and about. 

Beacon: This is where we put a device in a location and once you go within a certain range you are pinged by the app.

Geofence: We set an imaginary field around a selected area and once you cross into the area you get pinged.

Digital Media: This is from ads through the digital space which could be a Youtube video or an ad on Pandora.

Live Events: This is most commonly used at concerts, live shows, local events and much more!
